Kcal - Office 365 Meeting Room Dashboards
=================================

A pretty basic proof of concept that uses the Office 365 Json Api to display
dashboards for meeting rooms in the Kainos offices.

##Office Dashboard

The Office Dashboard shows an at a glance state of all the rooms in an office.
To prove the concept I installed it on a Raspberry Pi on a TV in the London
Office.

##Room Dashboard

The Room Dashboard gives each room a detailed overview of the state of the room.
It's designed to be run on a small 7 inch placed outside each room.
